let c;      <- c is undefined
let a = 34; <- a is 34
let b = 21; <- b is 21
a = 2;      <- a is now 2

Question 1: What is a + b?

Answer: 23 <- a is 2 and b is 21, so 2 + 21 is 23
Console Result: 23

Question 2: What is c?
Answer: c is still undefined.
Console Result: undefined

---------------------------------------------------------

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');

Question 3: What is the outcome of the above code?
Answer: "75"
Console Result: "75"

This is because we go from left to right.
Therefore, the first + is still doing addition because 3 and 4
are numbers.  However, when we reach the second +, we're doing
concatenation, because '5' is a string. Therefore, we're 
concatenating 7 to '5', which is '75'.
